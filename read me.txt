This simple app pulls the geolocation data from a user's browser and uses it to pass the gps points to the Ticketmaster API.

The app then requests events within a 20 miles of the user's location and displays the results as a table. The app also pins the location and, if availible, the picture of each venue where the events are held. 

This simple app uses:
    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    JQueary
    Ajax
    Google Maps API
    Ticktmaster API

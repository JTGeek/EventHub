This site was created as part of a Capstone project by James Timberlake.

The idea for this app came from my time as a "Digital Nomad" moving between cities for work. I had the chance to see some amazing places, but finding really cool local events was difficult. I didn't know who to ask, I wasn't sure what venues were good and which were sketcy, and even if I did I would have to gamble on if I liked the event of the night. EventHUB lets a computer or mobile user quicly see a list of upcoming events in their current area. They can see where each venue is in relation to themselves on the integrated Google Map. They are also able to quickly compare times/dates/venues and then click to buy tickets directly for the event they want.

Needed fixes:
    scroll-vertically for the overhang on the table.
        overflow hidden on inner (I think)
        and overflow: ???  (on map div)

    change color on menu icon to match salmon color.

    update readme file.
        find template from thinkful
        call this build v.1
        add elements needed for v.2

    have ticketmaster links open new tab.
